# Status

All status relevant properties properties of a component are combined into _modules_. Such a module is identified by the prefix of a status property name (ID). Both are called the status property _UID_.

The following tables shows all predefined property UIDs in Wirehome. Other services or adapters etc. may add their own UIDs.

Based on the available status UIDs the app (Wirehome.App) will try to find the best matching view for each component. So using this predefined properties is recommended.
