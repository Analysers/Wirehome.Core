# Modules

All properties of a component are combined into _modules_. Such a module is identified by the pefix of a property. Both are called the property _UID_.

The following tables shows all predefined property UIDs in Wirehome. Other services or adapters etc. may add their own property UIDs.

Based on the available property UIDs the app (Wirehome.App) will try to find the best matching view for each component. So using this predefined properties is recommended.
